# Vulnerabiliy

In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system. 

## Examples of vulnerabilities

Social engineering (security).

Memory safety violations

  Buffer overflows and over-reads

  Dangling pointers

Input validation errors, such as:

  Code injection

  Cross-site scripting in web applications

  Directory traversal

  E-mail injection

  Format string attacks

  HTTP header injection

  HTTP response splitting

  SQL injection

Privilege-confusion bugs, such as:

  Clickjacking

  Cross-site request forgery in web applications

  FTP bounce attack

Privilege escalation

Race conditions, such as:

  Symlink races

  Time-of-check-to-time-of-use bugs

Side-channel attack

  Timing attack

User interface failures, such as:

  Blaming the Victim prompting a user to make a security decision without giving the user enough information to answer it[32]

  Race Conditions

  Warning fatigue or user conditioning.

Some set of coding guidelines have been developed and a large number of static code analysers has been used to verify that the code follows the guidelines.

## Causes

- Complexity: Large, complex systems increase the probability of flaws and unintended access points.

- Familiarity: Using common, well-known code, software, operating systems, and/or hardware increases the probability an attacker has or can find the knowledge and tools to exploit the flaw.

  - 공격하고 싶은 대상이 어떤 OS 인지 어떤 라이브러리를 쓰는지 어떤 프로그램을 쓰는지 알아낸다면 그 OS, 라이브러리, 프로그램에 해당되는 취약점을 검색만 하면 공격 벡터를 알아낼 수 있는 것 

- Password management flaws: The computer user uses weak passwords that could be discovered by brute force.

- Internet Website Browsing: Some internet websites may contain harmful Spyware or Adware that can be installed automatically on the computer systems. 

  - 웹 브라우저에서 실행시킬 수 있는 자바스크립트 같은 언어로 악성코드를 짠 후 웹 페이지가 랜더링 될 때 실행시키는 거 

- Software bugs: The programmer leaves an exploitable bug in a software program. 

- Unchecked user input: The program assumes that all user input is safe. Programs that do not check user input can allow unintended direct execution of commands or SQL statements (known as Buffer overflows, SQL injection or other non-validated inputs).

- Not learning from past mistakes: for example most vulnerabilities discovered in IPv4 protocol software were discovered in the new IPv6 implementations.
